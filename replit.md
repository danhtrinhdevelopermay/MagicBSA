# AI Image Editor

## Overview

This project includes both a web application and a Flutter mobile app that provide AI-powered image editing capabilities, specifically background removal and object removal from images. The web version uses React frontend with Express backend, while the Flutter app is built for Android APK distribution. Both integrate with the Clipdrop API for AI image processing.

## Key Components

### Data Storage
- **Current Implementation**: In-memory storage using Map data structure
- **Production Ready**: PostgreSQL schema defined for image jobs
- **Storage Strategy**: File uploads stored in local `uploads/` directory
- **Job Tracking**: Comprehensive job status tracking (pending, processing, completed, failed)

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload Validation**: File type (JPEG, PNG, WEBP) and size (10MB) restrictions
2. **Job Creation**: Database record creation with metadata
3. **AI Processing**: Clipdrop API integration for background/object removal
4. **Result Storage**: Processed images saved and linked to jobs
5. **Status Updates**: Real-time job status updates

### UI Components
- **Upload Area**: Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- **Image Editor**: Preview and operation selection
- **Processing Overlay**: Real-time progress indication
- **Results View**: Before/after comparison with download/share options
- **Bottom Navigation**: Mobile-first navigation pattern

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User selects image file → Frontend validation → FormData creation
2. **Job Creation**: POST /api/jobs → Multer file processing → Database job record
3. **AI Processing**: POST /api/jobs/:id/process → Clipdrop API call → Result storage
4. **Status Polling**: Frontend queries job status → Real-time UI updates
5. **Result Display**: Processed image URL → Download/share functionality

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL serverless connection
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM
- **multer**: File upload handling
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **cmdk**: Command palette component

### External Services
- **Clipdrop API**: AI image processing service
  - Background removal endpoint
  - Object cleanup endpoint
  - Requires API key authentication

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Vite development server with HMR
- **API Server**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL or Neon development database

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite static build to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundling to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema deployment
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=production with optimized settings

### Configuration Requirements
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **CLIPDROP_API_KEY**: Clipdrop service authentication
- **File Storage**: Persistent storage solution for uploaded/processed images

### Scalability Considerations
- **File Storage**: Current local storage needs cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL ready for production scaling
- **API Rate Limits**: Clipdrop API usage monitoring needed
- **Caching**: React Query provides client-side caching
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and API error handling

The architecture supports both development and production environments with clear separation of concerns, type safety throughout the stack, and modern web development best practices.
